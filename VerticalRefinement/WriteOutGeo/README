In this directory we are writing out the geometry of a 3D simulation as well as
the ice velocity to allow for 3D remeshing. The following steps need to be
done.


1. Copy directory to a place where you want to run this.
2. Copy the .results files from a run into the "Mesh" directory
3. Copy the associated mesh.* files from your run of choice into the "Mesh" dir
as well 
4. Do the same with the partitioning* directory of you run of choice
5. Now adapt the paths in the Submit.sh script
6. Now adapt the number of CPUs in the Submit script (Everywhere!) to match
those of your run of choice
7. In the sif file adapt the numbers of vertical layers to match the run of
your choice and make sure that in Solver 6, the correct variable names are
listed. This may be different from run to run!
8. Now run the script. Should take about 1 minute
9. The geometry meaning zs,zb, and bedrock as well as the ice velocity are then
saved under GeoOut
10. As a sanity check run the following command: wc -l GeoOut/ZbOut and wc -l
Mesh/mesh.nodes on the command line. These numbers should match exactly!
11. Do the same for the velocity wc -l GeoOut/VelOut and wc -l Mesh/mesh.nodes.
The numbers of lines in VelOut should be the numbers of nodes (from mesh.nodes)
times the number of vertical layers.
12. If all sanity checks have successfully passed, we can use the
ScatteredInterpolant to read these back in either to refine the mesh
horizontally, vertically or both!
